				<h2>Skype Accessibility and Usability Evaluation</h2>
				<p>Skype is one of the most usable applications, which use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP">Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) </a> services and provides communication between the peers using the voice, video and text messages. Skype also supports the exchange of media files and video conferencing between several participants. Nowadays, Skype is available for different platforms and devices. The application continues to develop and encourages new users. Unfortunately, it seems that recent changes have not improved interface of the programme.</p>
				<h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>The application works adequately with Windows and external assistive tools, though build-in accessibility tools were not found in the programme. Surprisingly, desktop version of Skype contains Accessibility option which enables “Accessibility Mode”, but no accessibility improvements were found. Skype has intuitive graphical interface, but menu bar contains too many options which can be confusing. The usage of Skype tends to be difficult for people with hearing impairments because programme does not provide transcript and works badly with external text to speech tools.</p>

   				<h3>Usability</h3>
                <p>Desktop version of Skype was evaluated in usability and results are shown in Table IV. It seems adequately usa-ble and intuitive application, though some options of the programme can confuse people. All users’ actions and events are provided with reasonable and clear notifications; programme has user-friendly interface and customizable options. However, some unexpected errors can be appeared, and some additional advertising tend to distract users’ attention.</p>
