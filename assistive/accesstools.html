				<h2>Access Tools</h2>
				<p>&quot;Access tools&quot; is a portable software application that provides access to various software applications and docu-mentation and has functionally similar to Windows Explorer. Primarily, the software programme is designed to access all assistive software applications from one particular place, and also can be used to access other portable software applications. “Access tools” is a portable version of desktop software and does not require the installation. However, it is essential that root folder named as “accessTools”, otherwise the programme will not work properly.</p>
                <p>The interface of “Access tools” is clear and comprehensible and includes menu bar, content area and status bar. Menu bar contains three items as File, Settings and Help. The menu item File provides an opportunity to download new applications and exit the programme. The attempt to load additional applications failed. The programme displays the error message and unexpectedly quits.</p>
                <p>The menu item “Settings” allows to users to change the appearance of the programme. It includes the colour settings of font and background, font size and type. All users’ preferences will be saved in the programme for later use. The menu item “Help” contains instructions and information about “Access tools” software.</p>
                <p>Content area contains Explorer with three categories: Accessibility Guides, Accessibility Tools and Applications. “Access tools” documentation is available from Accessibility Guides item of the main content. Unfortunately, no way has been found to add additional documentation guides to the application. Accessibility Tools item provides access to assistive portable applications which should be stored in a particular folder (accessTools --> Categories --> Accessibility Tools). Application category tends to include other portable applications which should be stored also in a certain folder (accessTools --> Categories --> Applications). However, saving all applications in the particular folders can be confused for users, and it might be wise to allow users also specify the path to the applications that they wish to use in the programme.</p>
                <p>The status bar provides information about the state of the programme as well as displays the hints. Programme is totally accessible from the keyboard and number of shortcuts is available.</p>
                <p>The benefit of “Access tools” application is it can be used on different computers since set of the programs can be saved on the flash drive memory and all customizations are saved by the application. For people with disabilities, it can play a crucial role and make usage of different machines less struggling.</p>
