				<h2>ATbar</h2>
				<p>ATbar is an open source web tool which provides a variety of options to make websites more accessible for dif-ferent target groups regardless of type of browser. It can significantly improve accessibility of websites for people with different disabilities, and also, for foreign and average users. The programme contains many different options which benefit not just users, but developers as well. Developers provide several different versions of the application for any browser, Windows OS or it can be built-in directly in a particular site. Also, users have an option to create own ATbar by choosing essential instruments.</p>
                <p>Visually, the application is a set of buttons that trigger the appropriate plugins to process websites in more acces-sible way. ATbar consists a large number of options that can meet the needs of majority of struggling users.</p>
                <p>The evaluation showed ATbar is easy to use and tends to be helpful for the majority of users. It can be straight-forward implemented into the browser by an average user as well as developers can built-in it into a particular web-site if it is written in php programming language. Using ATbar can help to avoid the use of various external assistive programs and it perfectly works with evaluated above websites.
However, some lacks of the programme were discovered. Unfortunately, the options for deaf people and users with hearing impairments were not discovered. Also, users should have ability to change location of pop-up win-dows, because they can overlap on each other, for instance word prediction tooltip and style changing pop-up win-dow. As for text to speech recognition, probably it will be beneficial to add some setting to customize the speed of speech.
